# Typed HTML and SVG in Eliom

Eliom pages are built with TyXML (<https://ocsigen.org/tyxml>) through `Eliom.Content.Html`
and `Eliom.Content.Svg`. The type checker rejects invalid nesting (a `p` inside a `p`, a
`tr` outside a table) and the library escapes text and attribute values. This skill covers
how to use that machinery and why string-built markup has no place in an Eliom application.
Module names are those of Eliom 13 (`Eliom_content` in earlier releases).

## F or D

`Eliom.Content.Html` provides two node constructors with identical signatures:

- `F` (functional): abstract values. `To_dom.of_element` builds a fresh DOM node each time.
  Default for content nothing refers to later.
- `D` (DOM): nodes carry a unique id. On the client, `To_dom.of_element` returns the actual
  node in the page. Use `D` for any node that client code binds events on, reads or mutates,
  and pass its handle to client code with `~%`.

Mixing is normal: a `D.div` container holding `F` children. Prefer `F`; a `D` node costs an
id attribute and a lookup.

## Manipulating D nodes

In client sections, `Eliom.Content.Html.Manip` acts on `D` nodes directly: `appendChild`,
`appendChildren`, `removeChildren`, `replaceChildren`, `removeSelf`, `Class.add`,
`Class.remove`. Use it instead of converting to a DOM node by hand. `Eliom.Content.Svg.Manip`
does the same for SVG. When a lower-level API is needed (measuring, focus, `setAttribute`),
`To_dom.of_element node` gives the `Dom_html.element Js.t`.

## Reactive, client and global nodes

Besides `F` and `D`, `Eliom.Content.Html` provides:

- `R`: reactive nodes. The constructors take React signals (`Eliom.Shared.React.S.t`) and
  reactive lists (`Eliom.Shared.ReactiveData.RList.t`) where `F` takes plain values:
  `R.node s` renders the current value of `s` and updates the DOM when it changes, `R.pcdata`
  does the same for a string signal, and reactive attributes (`R.a_class`, ...) follow their
  signal. Shared signals render on the server and keep updating on the client.
- `C.node ?init cv`: a server-side node standing for a client value `cv` of type
  `'a elt Eliom.Client_value.t`. The server sends a placeholder (`~init`, a `span` by
  default) that the client replaces with the node it builds.
- Global elements: `Id.create_global_elt e` keeps the element and its modified content
  across page changes, so a chat box or a media player survives navigation with its state.
- Named elements: `Id.new_elt_id ()` and `Id.create_named_elt ~id e` give a node a stable
  identity; client code retrieves it later with `Id.get_element id`, even from another
  page.
- `Custom_data`: typed `data-*` attributes carrying an OCaml value
  (`Custom_data.create ~name ~to_string ~of_string ()` or `create_json`, then
  `Custom_data.attrib d v`), when a plain `a_user_data` string is not enough.

## Links and forms are typed

Links (`D.a ~service:Foo_services.user_page [txt "Profile"] userid`) and forms
(`Form.get_form`, `Form.post_form`, `Form.input ~input_type ~name Form.string`) are checked
against the service they target; the `eliom-server-side` skill covers them. In a
client-server application, build with `D` the forms and inputs that client code reads, and
add `~xhr:false` to links to server-only services (`eliom-architecture`).

## Markup is never built as strings

Do not assemble HTML or SVG as text and inject it: no `Printf.sprintf "<div class=\"...\">"`
followed by `el##.innerHTML := Js.string s`, `insertAdjacentHTML` or `outerHTML`; no
hand-written `esc` helper for `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`; no `style="..."` strings (styling lives in
stylesheets, per-element geometry in typed attributes).

Why: string markup bypasses TyXML's validity checking, becomes an XSS vector as soon as any
value is attacker-influenced, breaks the XML namespace handling that `To_dom` performs for
SVG and MathML, and cannot be checked against the document model. When escaping by hand
seems necessary, the typed equivalent exists.

| Instead of | Use |
|---|---|
| `innerHTML := markup` to replace content | build the typed subtree, then `Manip.replaceChildren node [subtree]` |
| `innerHTML := ""` | `Manip.removeChildren node` |
| `setAttribute "data-act" v` | `a_user_data "act" v` (renders `data-act`) |
| an SVG string | `Eliom.Content.Svg.F` nodes (below) |
| `style="left: 10px"` | a class in the stylesheet, or a typed attribute for a value that varies per element |
| a hand-rolled `esc` function | nothing: `txt` and attribute constructors escape |

## SVG

`Eliom.Content.Svg` mirrors `Html`: `F`, `D`, `Manip`, `To_dom`. Build `Svg.F.g`, `path`,
`rect`, `circle`, `line`, `text`, `title`, ... with typed attributes, and embed the result in
HTML with `Html.F.svg ~a:[Svg.F.a_viewBox (0., 0., w, h); Svg.F.a_class ["chart"]] [...]`.
The HTML `svg` element takes SVG children and SVG attributes (`Svg.F.a_*`).

Numeric attributes are typed, not strings: a length is a `Svg_types.Unit.length`, a float
with an optional unit such as `(13., None)` or `(50., Some `Percent)`; transforms are a
`Svg_types.transform list`; anchors are variants. `a_d` (path data) is a string by the SVG
specification itself. `references/svg.md` gives the attribute types with examples and a
complete drawing.

## Incremental updates and animation

- Re-rendering a typed subtree on each change or frame and swapping it in with
  `Manip.replaceChildren` is idiomatic, and fast enough for most interfaces.
- To adjust one attribute (a pan/zoom transform, a class toggle), keep the handle of the `D`
  node and set that attribute on its DOM node, or use `Manip.Class.*`. This is legitimate
  DOM mutation, not string injection.
- For values that change continuously, `Eliom.Shared.React` (reactive nodes) can replace
  manual updates when it keeps the code simpler.
