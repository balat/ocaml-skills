# Eliom application architecture

Eliom compiles one OCaml program into a server (native or bytecode) and a client (JavaScript
or WebAssembly through js_of_ocaml or wasm_of_ocaml). One source describes both tiers; ppx
section annotations decide where each definition lives. Documentation:
<https://ocsigen.org/eliom> (manual and API) and the tutorial
<https://ocsigen.org/tuto/latest/manual/basics>.

Services, typed parameters, registration modules, links, forms, Eliom references and
scopes are the same as in a server-side site: the `eliom-server-side` skill is the
reference for them. This skill covers what a multi-tier application adds.

Module names below are those of Eliom 13: `Eliom.Service`, `Eliom.Content`.
Eliom 12 and earlier use `Eliom_service`,
`Eliom_content`, and so on. `../eliom-client-server/references/module-names.md` gives the
mapping and how to tell which naming a project uses.

## Rendering model

- First request: the server renders the full HTML page. Search engines, and users without
  the client program, see an ordinary web site.
- Later navigation: the client program stays alive. Typed links and forms call
  `Eliom.Client.change_page`, which renders the next page in the browser without reloading.
  The application has the responsiveness of a single-page app while keeping URLs, links,
  forms and the back button.
- Data the client needs comes through RPCs. Render blocks that wait for data inside
  `Ot.Spinner` (Ocsigen Toolkit) so the rest of the page appears at once instead of waiting
  for the slowest call.
- Typical targets: a web app in browsers (server render first, client afterwards) and a
  mobile app in a Cordova webview (client rendering only, same server). Design responsive
  layouts from the start when both are targets.

## Which tier runs what

Write page content, widgets and handlers in shared sections so that pages can be generated
on either tier. Reserve single-tier sections for what genuinely belongs there:

| Tier | Belongs there | Annotation |
|---|---|---|
| Server only | database, file system, secrets, external services, authorization decisions | `let%server` |
| Client only | DOM manipulation, browser and device APIs, UI-only behaviour | `let%client` |
| Both | page rendering, widgets, page service registration | `let%shared` |

Register page services on both tiers, `let%shared () = App.register ~service ...`, where
`App` is the module the application obtains from `Eliom.Registration.App`; in-app navigation
then renders them on the client. Register on the server only when the service is not part
of the client program: REST or JSON endpoints, downloads, printable pages, services called by
third parties. Link to such a service with `~xhr:false` (`Eliom.Content.Html.D.a ~service
~xhr:false`) so the browser performs a real request instead of a client-side transition.

Client-server reactive programming (`Eliom.Shared.React`) is available; use it where it
makes the code simpler than rendering plus RPCs, not by default.

## File layout

Each feature `foo` is split by role. Give every `.eliom` used by other modules an `.eliomi`
exposing only what they need.

| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `foo_services.eliom(i)` | service definitions only |
| `foo_handlers.eliom(i)` | handlers: page generation, form processing |
| `foo.eliom(i)` | page content, widgets |
| `foo_container.eliom(i)` | layout shared by the feature's pages |
| `foo_db.ml` | server-only database access (plain `.ml`, never `.eliom`) |
| `foo_config.eliom` | configuration values |

Keep services and handlers in separate files: links and forms everywhere refer to services,
while handlers pull in the whole feature. Split a role file further when a feature grows.
This is the convention of the Ocsigen Start template; keep it consistent across the project.

## Services and remote calls

- Page services are ordinary GET services (`eliom-server-side`), registered with
  `App.register` on both tiers. Effectful actions stay POST services or become RPCs.
- Remote calls: `let%rpc f (x : t) : u Lwt.t = ...` with `ocsigen-ppx-rpc`; typing and
  serialisation rules are in the `eliom-client-server` skill. Prefer them to pathless
  services for calls made by the client program.
- Server-only services (downloads, printable pages, third-party endpoints) keep a plain
  server-side registration and are linked with `~xhr:false`.

## State across tiers

- Server-side state lives in Eliom references (scopes in `eliom-server-side`). The
  multi-tier application adds `Eliom.Common.default_process_scope`, one client process
  (one tab, or one mobile app instance), and Ocsigen Start adds scopes that survive login
  and logout (`ocsigen-start`).
- Ocsipersist (Ocsigen's key-value store, with SQLite, PostgreSQL and DBM backends) for
  application data that must survive restarts but has no other reader (caches, counters);
  the database (PostgreSQL through PG'OCaml in Ocsigen Start) for durable data that other
  tools may query. Both are server-only.
- Client-side state lives in `let%client` values for the life of the client program;
  values the client reads on every render are pushed once at session start (`ocsigen-start`).

## Trust boundary

The client program is under the user's control. Every RPC and every server handler
re-checks authorization on the server; client-side gating is a convenience for the user
experience. Never accept the current user's id from the client: the server knows it
(`Os.Current_user`). Details in the `ocsigen-start` skill.

## Errors and performance

- Handle HTTP errors with Eliom's error handler (`Eliom.Registration.set_exn_handler`,
  matching `Eliom.Common.Eliom_404` and `Eliom.Common.Eliom_Wrong_parameter`); do not let
  exceptions escape service handlers.
- Do not sequence independent remote calls (RPCs, queries): start them together and wait
  for both (`Lwt.both`, `Lwt_list.map_p`; see the `lwt` skill, plugin `lwt` of this
  marketplace).
