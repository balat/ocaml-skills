# Eliom client/server boundary

One `.eliom` file holds server code, client code and code compiled for both. Most bugs
specific to Eliom come from values crossing that boundary: when they are captured, how they
are serialised, and when the client code receiving them runs. Module names are those of
Eliom 13; `references/module-names.md` maps them to the names used by
Eliom 12 and earlier releases.

## Sections and annotations

- Annotate every top-level definition: `let%server`, `let%client`, `let%shared`,
  `type%client`, `module%server`, `open%client`. Prefer these to `[%%client.start]` and
  `[%%server.start]` blocks, which make the tier of a definition depend on distant context;
  do not add new blocks.
- Annotate server code too (`let%server` rather than bare `let`): the intent stays visible
  and survives reordering.
- Keep `open%...` to a few well-known modules (`Js_of_ocaml`, `Js_of_ocaml_lwt`,
  `Eliom.Content`, `Eliom.Content.Html`), each in the section where it applies. Refer to
  other modules qualified.
- Do not write JavaScript (no `Js.Unsafe.eval_string`, no inline scripts). Client behaviour
  is OCaml in client sections; Js_of_ocaml bindings cover the browser APIs.

## Types across the wire

- Type annotations: annotate every client value, `[%client (expr : t)]`, and every
  parameter of a `let%rpc` function. Annotate the RPC result too: the ppx requires it with
  the cache option, and it documents the wire contract everywhere else. Inference does not
  cross tiers, and the errors produced without annotations point elsewhere.
- Serialisation: RPC parameters and results, and values stored in persistent references,
  need `[@@deriving json]` (`type t = ... [@@deriving json]`). Injected values are
  marshalled and need no deriving, but they must be pure data (see Injections).
- Client integers are 32-bit under js_of_ocaml and 31-bit under wasm_of_ocaml. Any value
  that may exceed 2^30 (database ids, timestamps, amounts in cents, hashes) crosses into
  `%client` or `%shared` code as `Int64` or as a string. `int` arithmetic on the client
  corrupts such values silently while the 63-bit server does not, so the bug shows only in
  the browser. Ocsigen Start user ids are `int64` for this reason.
- A closed set of values that travels as a string (URL parameter, RPC field, cache key) is
  decoded once, at the boundary, into a `[@@deriving json]` variant and pattern-matched from
  there. Threading the raw string and re-comparing it with `| _ ->` fallbacks lets the two
  ends drift apart.

## Client values: what runs, and when

A `[%client expr]` block inside rendering code creates a client value: `expr` runs on the
client each time the enclosing rendering runs.

- Every client value reached during rendering runs, whether it is bound, ignored or placed
  in the DOM. `ignore [%client (e : unit)]` is enough; wrapping it in a placeholder `span`
  changes nothing.
- When it runs depends on which tier rendered the page:
  - Server-rendered page (first request): client values run after the browser has loaded
    the page. The DOM is in place.
  - Client-rendered page (navigation through `Eliom.Client.change_page`): client values run
    as soon as the rendering function returns, before the new DOM replaces the current one.
    A `Lwt.async (fun () -> Eliom.Client.change_page ...)` at the top of such a block is
    clobbered by the transition still in progress, and the navigation appears not to happen.
- A handler usually serves both paths, so defer anything that touches the freshly rendered
  page (programmatic navigation, focus, measurements) with
  `Eliom.Client.onload (fun () -> ...)`. It runs once the page is in place under both
  rendering paths.
- To wait for one node to be attached to the document, use
  `Ot.Nodeready.nodeready (To_dom.of_element node)` (Ocsigen Toolkit; it takes a DOM node).

## Injections

`~%v` inside a client value captures the server value `v` at rendering time and serialises
it to the client.

- Inject data only: strings, numbers, records, `D` node handles, `Eliom.Client_value.t`
  produced by another `[%client]`. Functions, channels and other non-serialisable values
  cannot cross.
- An injected value is a snapshot. For values that must keep updating on the client, use
  `Eliom.Shared.React` signals.
- Inject services and RPC stubs exactly once, at module load:

  ```ocaml
  let%server foo_service = Eliom.Service.create ...
  let%client foo_service = ~%foo_service
  ```

  This runs before any `App.register ~service:foo_service ...` (`App` being the
  application's `Eliom.Registration.App` module). Registration attaches a closure to the
  server-side service object, which then cannot be serialised. A later `~%foo_service`
  inside a `[%client]` block in a page handler makes the server raise
  `Failure "cannot wrap functional values"` while wrapping the request data. Look for that
  line in the server log: the page may still be served with the injection dropped, and the
  client-side effect never fires. Inside client code, use the module-level client identifier
  (`Foo_services.foo_service`), never `~%` again. The same holds for `let%rpc` stubs and any
  top-level value that gains a closure after server-side wiring.

## Client-side events and errors

- Bind events with `Lwt_js_events` (`clicks`, `mousedowns`, `changes`, ...) or attributes
  such as `a_onclick`. Functions with an `s` suffix loop over repeated events; the singular
  form waits for one occurrence (details in the `lwt` skill, plugin `lwt` of this
  marketplace).
- Wrap every RPC call made from client code in `Lwt.catch`: show the user a message
  (`Os.Msg.msg` in Ocsigen Start), log the detail, never fail silently. Inside an
  `Lwt_js_events` loop this matters most: the loop catches an exception escaping the handler
  and only logs it to the browser console, so the click appears to do nothing and the user
  sees no message. Put the catch in one shared click-handler helper rather than at each call
  site.
- Use `Lwt.catch` or `try%lwt`, not `try ... with`, around code that returns promises.
